# AirBnB_clone

# Project By Moussab el mahraoui

- One of the significant undertakings within the ALX Software Engineering program is the first project related to web development.
  The console functions as a command interpreter, akin to a standard Python interactive shell or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). It provides us with the means to execute commands and engage with the web application via a command-line interface, typically within a terminal. Through this command interpreter, our goal is to efficiently manage the objects within our project. This encompasses various tasks, such as creating new objects (e.g., users or places), retrieving objects from storage (like files or databases), performing operations on objects, such as counting and computing statistics, updating object attributes, and when necessary, deleting objects. Furthermore, the console serves as a valuable tool for debugging and identifying logic errors, as it enables us to experiment with the web application using different inputs and commands.

- In a nutshell, "the console"refers to a command-line interface that facilitates interaction with our web application's objects by executing commands and receiving corresponding outputs.

- In our Python-based Airbnb web application, we adhere to the principle that everything is treated as an object, indicating that they are instances of specific classes. This approach ensures a structured representation of various entities within our application. For instance, in our database:
- 1-An instance (object) of the "User" class represents an individual who has registered an account on the web app. It encompasses essential information such as name, email, and password.

- 2-Similarly, an instance (object) of the "State" class signifies a state or province, while an instance of the "City" class denotes a city within that state.

- 3-Additionally, we have instances of the "Place" class, which represent temporary accommodations available for booking on the web app. These instances contain pertinent details like the room or suite's name, description, location, price, and availability dates.

- This object-oriented approach ensures a structured and organized representation of data within our Airbnb web application.

- In this project, we encountered approximately 18 distinct tasks to solve. The advantage of these tasks lies in their ability to dissect the overall project into more manageable segments, allowing us to focus on each task individually.

- Furthermore, as these tasks come with clear prompts to guide us , their execution often becomes relatively straightforward.
  This project have to be ended in 7 days and demanded a team consisting of two members.
  We began with a thorough review of the concept pages and extensive brainstorming sessions to formulate our project approach. Ultimately, we made the decision to convene daily for as many hours as possible, dedicating our available time and effort to the project.

- The initial tasks we tackled were relatively straightforward. However, there were some among them for which we lacked prior knowledge, prompting us to search online for resources that could provide us with explanations. I distinctly recall one such task: "How to utilize the UUID module in Python."

## 0x01 Introduction

Team project to build a clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

To see the fundamental background of the project visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ralexrivero/AirBnB_clone/wiki).

The console will perform the following tasks:

- create a new object
- retrive an object from a file
- do operations on objects
- destroy an object

### Storage

All the classes are handled by the `Storage` engine in the `FileStorage` Class.
